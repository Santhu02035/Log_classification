# ðŸš€ Log Classification with Hybrid Framework

This project presents a **hybrid log classification system** designed to handle real-world, large-scale log data with varying complexities. By integrating **Regex**, **BERT-based models**, and **LLMs**, the framework achieves flexible, robust, and accurate classification.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Log messages vary in structure and complexity. Traditional models fail when:
- Patterns are too rigid or dynamic
- Labeled data is sparse
- Complex semantic understanding is required

**Our hybrid system dynamically chooses the right tool for each type of pattern.**
